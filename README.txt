Udacity-Web-Dev
===============
The content of this project is all of what I'm
learning in Udacity's CS253 - Intro to Web Development.
More details at: https://www.udacity.com/course/cs253

This will be a way for me to simultaneously learn
basic web development and version control systems.

All of this is currently for my amateur, personal use.
